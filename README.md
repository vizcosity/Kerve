## Introduction

During the 2020 pandemic, as an experiment to learn SwiftUI, 'Kerve' was born. Kerve is an iOS app that beautifully visualizes COVID-19 statistics using captivating graphs with bright colors and gradients.

## Features

Kerve uniquely offers real-time statistics for any country specified, delivered straight to your homescreen and watch. Its features include:

- **Visual Graphs**: Kerve beautifully presents the spread rate, death rate, and other statistics for COVID-19 in a user-friendly graph format.
- **Real-time Updates**: The data is fetched live from a reliable source, ensuring users are always up to date with the latest statistics.
- **Homescreen Widgets & Watch Complications**: In a first-of-its-kind offering on the App Store, users can view real-time updates of COVID statistics from their chosen country right on their homescreen or watch.

## Libraries Used

Kerve is built entirely on SwiftUI and leverages various libraries, including:

- [SwiftCharts](https://github.com/i-schuetz/SwiftCharts): A library used for creating beautiful and customizable charts.
